Predicting Fluctuation of Food Price in Bangladesh Using Machine Learning Methods

Abstract. Food price fluctuation causes adverse effect on economic development
in Bangladesh. In contrast with the past, food prices stepping up rigorously. Long term
instability in prices initiates immoderate volatility. Several factors are responsible for
fetching volatility in the food market. For instance, demand and supply, weather, food
production and many more. Learning goal of this paper is to predict food price fluctuation using pre-processed prices of selected foods dataset, machine learning methods,
combined with non-linear regressions. Regression models were used as a comparison
among MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, RMSLE, MAPE and time in seconds. Lasso provided
least Mean Squared Error compared to other regression model. Contribution of this
work goes to various classes i.e., farmers, investors, government etc. By inducing the
knowledge of future market in food prices, investors or Farmers can have proper idea
of when to invest money on food production.
